## First blog post
Why did choose to write a public blog?
* This blog is going to be like a time capsule of the state of my mind, I long for the nostalgic feel.
* Since it's publically hosted, I need to take an extra effort in correcting spellings, etc. i.e, there is a scope of self-improvement.

What will I be writing about?
* I will be rambling about my existential crisis and how everything around me is a conspiracy.
* The working of the human mind has always been intriguing, I will write about my learning proces.
* Maybe about some technical ideas... Maybe not.
* I love manga and anime, yeah... I will talk about why I like certain characters and shows, for a 22 year old man to be talking about anime may seem immature to many people, I have a different perspective.


Finally, I hope I maintain this blog.. if not, "Hey this was your first and last blog post."  
Reminder: I wrote this during the country lockdown because of COVID-19.
