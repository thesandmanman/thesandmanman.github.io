### Why did decide to write a public blog?
* I intend this be a time capsule of the state of my mind also I long for a nostalgic feel.
* Since it's publically hosted, I need to take an extra effort in correcting spellings, etc. i.e, I see a scope of self-improvement.

### What will I be writing about?
* Rambling about my existential crisis and how everything around me is a conspiracy.
* The way the human mind works has always intriged me, I will write about my learning proces.
* Maybe about some technical ideas... Maybe not.
* I love manga and anime, yeah...


Finally, I hope I maintain this blog.. if not, >"Hey this was your first and last blog post."  
_Reminder_: I wrote this during the country lockdown because of COVID-19.
