### Movtivation to write this public blog?
* I intend this be a time capsule of the state of my mind (also long for a nostalgic feel later).
* Since it's publically hosted, extra efforts to be made in correcting spellings & formatting i.e, I see a scope of self-improvement.

### What will I be writing about?
* Rambling about my existential crisis and how everything around me is a conspiracy.
* The way the human mind works has always intriged me, I will write about my learning proces.
* Maybe about some technical ideas, maybe...
* I love manga & anime, yeah...


Finally, I hope I maintain this blog... if not, "Hey this was your first & last post".

>_**Fact**_: You made this blog and many other small projects during COVID-19 lockdown, actually impressed.
